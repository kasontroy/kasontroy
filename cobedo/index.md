##Hi, I'm Kason
I use tools like HTML5, CSS(Less/Sass), and PHP on platforms like foundation, jekyll and drupal to build responsive sites and custom projects.

It's cool. You don't have to know most of that means.

While my toolbox can be technical, my strength is working with people.

I work with designers and developers to build what you need.

See my [portfolio](/contact) to see what I've been working on lately.
