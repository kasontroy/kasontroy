##Hi, I'm Kason

I'm a Web Designer/Developer.

While I use visual tools like Photoshop and Illustrator, I also use tools like HTML5, CSS(Less/Sass), javascript/jQuery and PHP on platforms like Bootstrap to build responsive sites and working style guides.

I design and build clean, functional experiences for the the modern world.
