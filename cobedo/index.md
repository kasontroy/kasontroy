##Hi, I'm Kason

I'm not your typical UI/UX Designer. 

While I use visual tools like Photoshop and Illustrator, I also use tools like HTML5, CSS(Less/Sass), javascript/jQuery and PHP on platforms like Bootstrap to build responsive sites and working style guides.

It's cool. You don't have to know what most of that means. 

Just know that I design (and sometimes build) clean, functional experiences for the the modern world.
