##Hi, I'm Kason

I'm a UI/UX Designer/Developer based in Dallas, TX. Design has traditionally be done in a graphical design program, then handed to a developer to implement. This is not how I design. In today's multi-screen world, web design has to be more. I use tools like Photoshop and Illustrator as a sketch pad, or to quickly get a specific point across, but the majority of my design is done in code as a style guide or interactive prototype.

I use tools like HTML5, CSS(Less/Sass), javascript/jQuery and PHP on platforms like Bootstrap, Foundation, Jekyll, Wordpress and Drupal to build responsive sites and custom projects.

It's cool. You don't have to know what most of that means. 

Just know that I design (and sometimes build) clean, functional experiences for the the modern world.
