##Hi, I'm Kason
I use tools like HTML5, CSS(Less/Sass), javascript/jQuery and PHP on platforms like Bootstrap, Foundation, Jekyll, Wordpress and Drupal to build responsive sites and custom projects.

It's cool. You don't have to know what most of that means.

While my toolbox can be technical, my strength is working with people. I work with designers and developers to build what you need.

Check out my [portfolio](/portfolio) to see what I've been working on lately.
